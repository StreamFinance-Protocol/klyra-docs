# Collateral Pools

## Introductory
As described in the overview, perpetuals are always backed by collateral. A natural question that arises about what collateral a perpetual should support? Imagine two traders wish to trade with different collaterals and refuse to accept anything else, then they cannot trade against each other because there would be no way to pay profits and losses to the other. In other words, the only way for two traders with different collateral to trade with each other is if they are willing to accept the other trader's collateral. In general, this is an assumption that is untrue, a trader may only trust USDC and BTC and not want to trade with someone using Dogecoin. However, we want Klyra to allow a user that wishes to trade with Dogecoin collateral to do so. 

In order to achieve this, Klyra uses separate collateral pools to back trades, ensuring safety for the platform and its users. Each pool holds specific types of collateral, like USDC or Dogecoin, and they are kept completely separate to avoid one pool's problems affecting the others. For example, if Dogecoin decreases in value, it won’t impact traders in the USDC pool. Some pools also allow multiple types of collateral, like USDC and BTC, so traders can use different assets together. Additionally, certain pools can earn yield, giving traders a chance to earn money while keeping their positions open. When opening a perpetual position, a user can specify which pool they opt in. Furthermore, the configurations of each pool are publicly available and verifiable.

## Advanced
Klyra is built on a system of independent collateral pools, where each pool operates independently to minimize risk and ensure stability - for example, each pool has a separate insurance fund (read advanced liquidation docs for more information). These pools can hold specific collateral types, such as USDC or USDT, or even a mix of assets like USDC and BTC, enabling diverse trading possibilities. Pools that supported multi collateral are not yet available but are being built. The isolation of pools ensures that events like a USDT depeg do not impact traders in other pools, such as those using USDC. This separation also allows governance to define tailored risk and reward parameters for each pool, catering to both conservative and esoteric markets. Furthermore, some collateral pools are designed to generate yield, providing traders with passive income opportunities while maintaining open positions. This flexible and secure approach makes Klyra adaptable to various trading needs while safeguarding users' funds.

In Klyra, perpetual markets are tied directly to their collateral pools, meaning a perpetual is unique to the pool it belongs to. For example, if there are two separate pools—one holding USDC and the other holding USDT—and both offer a BTC perpetual market, a trader in the USDC pool cannot trade with a trader in the USDT pool. This separation exists to isolate risk for users, ensuring that issues in one pool do not affect others. It is also intuitive—since profits, losses, and funding payments rely on the collateral within a specific pool, there is no way for traders in separate pools to settle these obligations with each other.

When opening a position, users specify the collateral pool they want to use, providing a guarantee that their exposure is limited to that pool's assets. This ensures safety and predictability for traders, as they are not affected by risks in other pools. However, this structure can lead to liquidity fragmentation, where smaller or more esoteric pools may have fewer participants and lower liquidity compared to larger pools as they can only trade with traders using the same esoteric collateral. To address this, Klyra's primary collateral pool will initially include USDC, BTC, and ETH, as these assets satisfy a wide range of needs while ensuring strong liquidity and maintaining high security due to their stability and reliability.

Changes to a pool's structure, such as adding or removing collateral types, can only be made through a governance vote. This process ensures that any changes are gradual and transparent, giving traders time to adjust their strategies accordingly. While new and experimental pools can be introduced, they may cater to niche markets with inherently lower liquidity than the main pools. This design allows Klyra to support diverse trading needs while maintaining clear boundaries for risk management.
