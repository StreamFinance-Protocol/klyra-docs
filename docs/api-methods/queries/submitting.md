# Submitting
Querying klyra can be done in two ways: through the KlyraSDK or directly through https requests. The way to query using the sdk is documented in both [markets](./markets.md) and [accounts](./accounts.md). To directly use https requests, you will need to use an indexer url which is the data indexing component of Klyra's infrastructure. All queries need to be submitted to this indexer url.

:::note
You can find a valid indexer url [here](../../indexer.md)
