## What is Klyra?
Klyra is the base financial infrastructure for a variety of stakeholders: traders, market makers, exchanges, and developers. Klyra provides the rails that connects these core stakeholders in a robust and decentralized system. Klyra enables 24/7 global markets to push the edge on a credibly neutral financial system.

## Use Cases
- **one derivative, multiple platforms**: as a trader, utilize different features from different exchanges while interacting with the same derivative position
- **new products, no cold start**: for exchanges, seamlessly launch new financial product to your users without the need to source liquidity and build core infrastructure
- **plug in code extensions**: for developers, build custom custom features that integrate directly into the core infrastructure. Imagine if you could permissionlessly write new features on the New York Stock Exchange
